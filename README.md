# SheetModel.jl

**To run the model**, execute the script `examples/run_SHMIP.jl`.

The most relevant stuff is in `src/modelonly.jl`

**Documentation** can be found at https://github.com/pohlan/MA-notes. In particular, the `spatial_discretisation.tex` explains which grids are used, how derivatives, gradients etc. are discretised and how boundary conditions are imposed.
